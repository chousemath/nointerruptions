# `www.nointerruptions.io`

> The purpose of this platform is to prevent interruptions to developer workflow. Interruptions are detrimental for all knowledge workers, but they are especially bad for programmers because of the mental models they need to maintain.

# Project Scope

* Schedule blocks of time where the following platforms are blocked out: email, slack, telegram, facebook)
* You are responsible for finding a quiet place where coworkers cannot easily interrupt you, but you have the option of updating your profile with your location (in case of emergencies)
* There is an interface for scheduling blocks of time into your google and apple calendars and amazon calendars
* There is an interface for you to negotiate which times in your schedule you cannot be interrupted with your manager (in case you have frequent team meetings)
* Present the developer with some [processes](https://tosbourn.com/pragmatic-approach-to-interruption-whilst-developing/) for dealing with interruptions when they inevitably occur
* Have some kind but stern email / slack message templates for developers to voice their requests for stricter enforcement of no-interruptions time to the rest of their team (prevents passive aggression)
* Integration with Jira, github issues, and gitlab issues
